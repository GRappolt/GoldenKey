<body><H1>Background</H1>
<P>This world can be both heaven and hell.  It's hell when your mind
 is filled with bad things - problems, failures, loss and pain.  It's
 heaven when your mind is filled with good things.</P>
<P>You can train your mind to focus more on the good things of the world.
  It's a matter of practicing thinking about good things, and feeling
 happy about them.  As with any kind of training, steady practice is key.</P>
<P> This app helps you train.  You start by building a list of good things,
 and then use that list to practice thinking about good things.</P>
<P>After a week of regular, daily practice, you will find yourself starting
 to sometimes feel really good for no particular reason.  Keep on training,
 and this will happen more and more often, and more strongly.  After a
 month of steady practice, you will feel happy most of the time.</P>
<P>Steady practice is the golden key to paradise.</P>
<H1>Build List</H1>
<P>Before you can practice, you need a list of good things.  Use the <B>Build List</B>
 screen to create that list.  Enter things that make you happy into the text
box, and press the <B>Add</B> button after each one.</P>
<P>For example, let's say you like hotdogs.  Enter \"hotdogs\" in the text box –
all you need is the one word.  Notice that the example is hotdogs - probably not
 the greatest thing you've ever eaten, but good.  You need a lot of things that make
 you happy for your list – but they don't all have to be wonderful.  Just good is
 good enough.</P>
<P>You will need lots of things that make you happy in your list - and lots of
 different kinds of things.  Food, pets, friends, things you are proud of, natural
 beauty, special moments in your life, music, movies, books, sex, big and little
 victories, insights, escapes from danger and relief from pain - anything and
 everything you can feel good about.  Humor (favorite jokes, funny happenings) is
 especially good. </P>
<P>Once you've made a good start on your list, you can begin training.  However,
 that shouldn't stop you from adding to your list.  Keep growing the list as long as
 you keep practicing.</P>
